Program 1 : What is the expected output of the following Python code given below :-

data = (10, 501, 22, 37, 100, 999, 87, 351]
result filter (lambda x: x > 4, data)
print (list (result))

Logic : Here We are Trying to Filter the Given List and Print the List Values which are greater than 4 only . 
And in the Given List all values are greater than 4 so the :

Expected Output is [10, 501, 22, 37, 100, 999, 87, 351]

Program 2 : Write a Python code using Lambda function to check every element of a List is an Integer or String ?

Logic : Here We have taken a List which contains multiple String and Integar Value , and in the Lambda function we are checking 
the instance of with the help of isinstance and integrating it with the help of map and finally printted the result
===========================================================================================================================
Program 3 :  Using the Python Lambda function create a Fibonacci series from 1 to 50 elements ?

Logic : Here i have taken the List with first two elements and then in Lambda function append the next value of the series by 
adding last two elements with the help of for loop iterated for 50 elemets

Program 4 :  Write a Python function to validate the Regular Expression for the following:-
a.) Email Address
b.) Mobile numbers of Bangladesh
c.) Telephone numbers of USA
d.) 16 character Alpha-Numeric password composed of alphabets of Upper Case, Lower Case, Special Characters, Numbers
